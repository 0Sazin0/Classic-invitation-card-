<h1> What a wonderfull world</h1>
<p> I see trees so green, red roses too
    I see them bloom for me and you.
    And I think to myself what a wonderful world.
    I see skies so blue and clouds so white.
    The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night.
    And I think to myself what a wonderful world.
    The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
    Are also on the faces of people going by.
    I see friends shaking hands saying how do you do.
    They're really saying I love you.
    I hear babies crying, I watch them grow.
    They'll learn much more than I'll ever know.
    And I think to myself what a wonderful world.
    Yes I think to myself what a wonderful world
    Yes I think to myself what a wonderful world.
